<h1 class="rainbow-text">Hello, world! It is a phrase, thought as a tossaway. Yet, it has a greater meaning. This one phrase, represents a new phase. The ability, to take a thought, one thought, and make it real. Now, you can see it, you feel it, and maybe even touch it. It is no longer just an idea, just a thought. Hello world, I am ready.</h1>
